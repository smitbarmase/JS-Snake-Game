# Smooth Scrolling Snake Game JS
Welcome to Smooth Scrolling Snake Game! I built this game because I was fascinated by javascript and HTML Canvas, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this game just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!): https://smitbarmase.github.io/Smooth-Scrolling-Snake-Game-JS/
